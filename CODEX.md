**Objective:** Integrate the new ARTI Sigma logo and favicon (provided in the images) across the application, specifically updating the header and making the full square logo prominent on the landing page.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Update Favicon:**

      * Locate the existing favicon (currently showing the PetLog paw icon, as seen in Image 2).
      * Replace it with a new favicon that is a **clean, monochromatic, simplified version of the 'ARTI' text from the new logo, or a simplified version of the 'Sigma' symbol.** The color should match the blue of the new logo.

2.  **Update Header Logo:**

      * Locate the logo/project title in the application's header (currently "PetLog" or a placeholder).
      * Replace it with the **text "ARTI Sigma"** rendered in a font that closely matches the new logo's typography. The color should be the same blue as in Image 1.
      * Ensure the logo is appropriately sized and aligned within the header.

3.  **Landing Page Full Logo Showcase:**

      * On the main landing page (`/pages/index.tsx`), place the **full ARTI Sigma logo (as seen in Image 1, including the tagline)** prominently.
      * The logo should be centered or strategically placed to be a primary visual element, demonstrating the brand identity.
      * Ensure the logo scales responsively for different screen sizes.

**Reference Images:**
